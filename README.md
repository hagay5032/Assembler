# Assembler
This is an assembler program. And it simulte an assembler. This assembler program takes an assembly file( of a demo assembly language) 
with extension ".as"  and analysing and produce three files - entry , extern and object files.

The assembly language is just a demo and there is infinite restrictions to produce the output files.

And for protecting the production rights of this excerise writer. I must stop explain it. But You are welcome to see 
and execute my solution.

This program is in C language. And I use visual studio 2019.
